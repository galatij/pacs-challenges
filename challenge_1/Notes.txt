README is well done. You could explicitly say how to choose the step alpha (however, it is easily understandable from the code).

The formulations of heavyball are equivalent, there is no need for implementing both.
Nesterov and heavyball are two different methods.

You should add a check and a warning on the method choice for invalid inputs.
You could have declared and defined the funciton read_parameters inside the same header and source files as the parameters struct.

Good use of the standard library and template functions.
The code is well commented and organized.
